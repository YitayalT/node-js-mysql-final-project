	Here we build and use a database for a hypothetical Health Record Management System, HRMS portal

	You will be required to write select statements and create DB objects like Stored procs, views and triggers

	TABLES : Patient, Doctor, Disease and Diagnosis, Medicine, PharmacyPersonel, Prescription, MedicinePrescribed, ...

	- First understnad the design of the database - tables and their relationships
	- If at any point you cound't insert the data give nor encountered a problem - try to figre out what caused it.

/****************** The SELECT Statement *****************************

SELECT statement
	- SELECT statement is used to query tables and views,

SYNTAX :
	SELECT select_list ` INTO new_table `
	` FROM table_source ` 
	` WHERE search_condition `
	` GROUP BY group_by_expression `
	` HAVING search_condition `
	` ORDER BY order_expression ` ASC | DESC ` `


Has has the following clauses inside, 
	- FROM clause
		: specifies the source of data, table or view
	- WHERE clause
		: search condition / criteria 
	- GROUP BY clause
		: group by list
	- HAVING clause
		: search condition / criteria for out put of GROUP BY clause
	- ORDER BY clause
		: specify the condition to sort results

Sequence of execution/evaluation of SELECT statement. 
	1st : FROM clause
	2nd : WHERE clause
	3rd : GROPUP BY clause
	4th : HAVING clause
	5th : SELECT 
	6th : ORDER BY clause

IMPORTANT : To avoid erros in tables/views name resoulution, it is best to include
	        schema and object name

			If the table/view contains irregular characters such as spaces or other 
			special characters, you need to delimit, or enclose the name, by backtick ``

			End all statements with semicolon (;) character. It is optional to use semi
			colon to terminate SELECT statement, however future versions will require 
			its use, therefore you should adopt the practice.

-- EXERCISE # 01
-- Write SELECT statement to retrive the entire columns of Employee table by explicitly listing each column.
-- NOTE (1) List all the columns to be retrived on SELECT statement
-- NOTE (2) The name of each column must be separated by comma
SELECT empId,empFName, empLName, SSN, Dob, gender, salary, employedDate,strAddress, apt, city, state, zipCode, phoneNo, email, empType From Employee  

-- EXERCISE # 02 
-- Repeat the previous exercise, but SSN and DoB must be displated as the 1st and 2nd column
-- NOTE : The order of columns list determine their display, regardless of the order of defination in source table.
SELECT SSN, Dob, empId,empFName, empLName,  gender, salary, employedDate,strAddress, apt, city, state, zipCode, phoneNo, email, empType From Employee  


-- EXERCISE # 03 
-- Write SELECT statement to retrive the entire columns of Employee table using "star" character (*)
-- NOTE : This method is frequently used for quick test, refrain using this short cut in production environment
SELECT * FROM Employee


-- EXERCISE # 04 
-- Write SELECT statement to retrive empId, empFName, empLName, phoneNo and email columns of Employee table.
SELECT empId, empFName, empLName, phoneNo, email FROM Employee


/*
-- SELECT statement can be used to perform calculations and manipulation of data
	Operators, 
		'+' : Adding or Concatinate
		'-' : Subtract
		'*' : Multiply
		'/' : Divide
		'%' : Modulo
	The result will appear in a new column, repeated once per row of result set
	Note : Calculated expressions must be Scalar, must return only single value
	Note : Calculated expressions can operate on other colums in the same row
*/

-- EXAMPLE : 
-- Calculate the amount each type of medicine worth in stock


-- EXERCISE # 05 
-- The unit price of each medicine is increased by 6%. Provide the list of medecine with 
-- their respective rise in price.
SELECT unitPrice + (unitPrice * 0.06) as newprice from Medicine

-- EXERCISE # 06
-- Calculate and display the old and new prices for each medicine 
SELECT unitPrice as oldprice, unitPrice + (unitPrice * 0.06) as newprice from Medicine


-- '+' Can be used to as an operator to concatenate (linked together as in a chain) the content of columns
-- EXAMPLE : Get Employee Full Name of all employees


-- EXERCISE # 07
-- Write a code to display employee's Full Address, and Phone Number

-- CONCAT Function
-- Is string function that joins two or more string values in an end-to-end manner.
-- SYNTAX: CONCAT ( string_value1, string_value2, string_value2, ...)
-- EXAMPLE : Write a code to display the Full Name of all employees using CONCAT function
CONCAT(empFName , empLName, strAddress, apt,city, state,zipCode );


-- EXERCISE # 08
-- Write a code to display employee's Full Address, and Phone Number using CONCAT function
CONCAT(empFName , empLName);

/*
DISTINCT statement
	SQL query results are not truly relational, are not always unique, and not guranteed order
	Even unique rows in a source table can return duplicate values for some columns
	DISTINCT specifies only unique rows to apper in result set

*/


-- EXAMPLE :
-- Write a code to retrive the year of employement of all employees in Employee table
SELECT DISTINCT employedDate FROM Employee

-- Notice there are redudant instances on the result set. Execute the following code
-- and observer the change of result set


-- EXERCISE # 09
-- Write a code that retrive the list of dosages from MedicinePrescribed table, use DISTINCT to eliminate duplicates

/*
Column Aliases
	- At data display by SELECT statement, each column is named after it's source.
	- However, if required, columns can be relabeled using aliases
	- This is useful for columns created with expressons
	- Provides custom column headers.

Table Aliases
	- Used in FROM clause to provide convenient way of refering table elsewhere 
	  in the query, enhance readability 

*/



-- EXAMPLE : 
-- Display all columns of Disease table with full name for each column

-- Using '=' signs to assign alias to columns


-- EXERCISE # 12
-- Use '=' to assign alias for the new price of all medecines with price rise by 13%
SELECT unitPrice + (unitPrice * 0.13)  newprice from Medicine



-- EXAMPLE :
-- Using built in function on a column in the SELECT list. Note the name of column is used as input for the function


-- EXAMPLE : 
-- Write a code to display the the first name and last name of all patients. Use table alias to refer the columns

SELECT p.pFName, p.pLName FROM Patient as  p

-- EXERCISE # 13 
-- Assign the appropriate aliases for columns displayed on previous exercise. 
SELECT p.pFName as patientFirstName, p.pLName  as patientLastName FROM Patient as  p



-- EXAMPLE
-- The following code will run free from error, since alias dicleration done before alias used by ORDER BY clause

-- The following code will err out, since alias decleration done after the execution of WHERE clause
SELECT empId AS `Employee ID`, empFName AS `First Name`, empLName AS `Last Name`
FROM Employee
WHERE `First Name` LIKE 'R%';

	- FROM clause can contain tables and operators
*** - Resulst set of FROM clause is virtual table
		: Subsequent logical operations in SELECT statement consume this virtual table
	- FROM clause can establish table aliases for use by subsequent pharses of query
	
	- JOIN : is a means for combining columns from one (self-join) or more tables by using values

	- Types of JOINs
		 CROSS JOIN : 
			: Combines all rows in both tables (Creates Carticial product)
		 INNER JOIN ( JOIN )
			: Starts with Cartecian product, and applies filter to match rows

			: MOST COMMONLY USED TO SOLVE BUSINESS PROBLEMS.
		 OUTER JOIN
			: Starts with Cartician product, all rows from designated table preserved,
			  matching rows from other table retrived, Additional NULL's inserted as
			  place holders

			: Types of OUTER JOIN
				: LEFT OUTER JOIN ( LEFT JOIN )
					- All rows of LEFT table is preserved, 
				: RIGHT OUTER JOIN ( RIGHT JOIN )

/********** Some Join Exercises ***************

	Write Queries for the following

	1- Get Patients' information: MRN, Patient Full Name, and Diagnosed Date of those diagnosed for disease with dId = 3
		(Use filter in Where clause in addition to Joining tables Patient and Diagnosis)

			SELECT P.mrn, P.pFName + ' ' + P.pLName AS PATIENTNAME,D.diagDate
			FROM PATIENT AS P JOIN DIAGNOSIS AS D ON P.MRN = D.MRN
			WHERE D.DID=3


	2- Get the Employee Id, Full Name and Specializations for All Doctors
		
			SELECT CONCAT(E.empFName,' ',E.empLName) AS `EMPLOYEE NAME`, E.empId, D.Specialization
			FROM Employee AS E JOIN Doctor AS D on e.empId=D.empId

	3- Get Disease Ids (dId) and the number of times Patients are diagnosed for those diseases
	   (Use only Diagnosis table for this)
			- Can you put in the order of (highest to lowest) based on the number of times people diagnosed for the disease?
			- Can you get the top most prevaLENGTHt disease?


			SELECT did, count(did)
			FROM Diagnosis
			GROUP BY did
			ORDER BY count(did)


			SELECT TOP (2) did, count(did)
			FROM Diagnosis
			GROUP BY did

		- Can be used as a source for queries in much the same way as tables themselves
				: Can also be used to Join with tables
		- Replaces commonly run query/ies
		- Can't accept input parameters (Unlike Table Valued Functions (TVFs))

		- Components
			: A name
			: Underlaying query

		- Advantages
			- Hides the complexity of queries, (large size of codding)
			- Used as a mechanism to implement ROW and COLUMN level security
			- Can be used to present aggregated data and hide detail data

		- SYNTAX 
			: To create a view:

/*********************************    TRIGGERS    ***********************************************

TRIGGERS - 
	- Are a special type of stored procedures that are fired/executed automatically in response
	  to a triggering action
	- Helps to get/capture audit information
	- Like stored procedures, views or functions, triggers encapsulate code.  
	- Triggers get fired (and run) by themselves only when the event for which they are 
	  created for occurs, i.e. We do not call and run triggers, they get fired/run 
	  by by their own


	Types of triggers
		- DML triggers
			: Fires in response to DML events (Insert/Delete/Update)
		- DDL triggers
			: Fires in response to DDL events (Create/Alter/Drop)
		- login triggers
			: Fires in response to login events

	DML Triggers
		There are two types of DML Triggers: AFTER/FOR and INSTEAD OF, and there are 
		three DML events (INSERT, DELETE and UPDATE) under each type - 

				AFTER	INSERT
						DELETE
						UPDATE

				BEFORE	INSERT
						DELETE
						UPDATE

		
	Syntax: 
		Whenever a trigger is created, it must be created for a given table, and for a 
		specific event, 
		
		CREATE TRIGGER <trigger name>                         --  name of the trigger
		ON <table name>										  --  name of table
		<AFTER | BEFORE INSERT/DELETE/UPDATE>         --  specific event 
		AS 
			BEGIN
				<your t-sql statement>
			END	


	Uses for triggers:
		- Enforce business rules
		- Validate input data
		- Generate a unique value for a newly-inserted row in a different file.
		- Write to other files for audit trail purposes
		- Query from other files for cross-referencing purposes
		- Access system functions
		- Replicate data to different files to achieve data consistency

/*
The use of 'inserted' table and 'deleted' table by triggers.

	- DML trigger statements use two special tables: the deleted table and the inserted tables. 
	- SQL Server automatically creates and manages these two tables. 
	- They are temporary, that only lasts within the life of trigger
	- These two tables can be used to test the effects of certain data modifications 
	  and to set conditions for DML trigger actions.

	- In DML triggers, the inserted and deleted tables are primarily used to perform the following:
		- Extend referential integrity between tables.
		- Insert or update data in base tables underlying a view.
		- Test for errors and take action based on the error.
		- Find the difference between the state of a table before and after a data 
		  modification and take actions based on that difference.


**** - The deleted table stores copies of the affected rows during DELETE and UPDATE statements.
***  - The inserted table stores copies of the affected rows during INSERT and UPDATE statements.

-- EXERCISE - TRIGGER # 07  (Using 'inserted' table)
-- Create a trigger that displays the inserted record on RentalCust table


-- EXAMPLE - TRIGGER # 08  (Using 'deleted' table)

-- EXAMPLE - TRIGGER # 09  (Using 'deleted' table)
-- Create following audit table, that maintains/captures the records deleted/removed from HotelCust
-- and create a trigger that inititate data backup when a record is deleted from HotelCust table 
-- Note : Use FOR/AFTER DELETE trigger as required.


-- EXERCISE - TRIGGER # 10  (Using 'inserted' table)
-- Create Audit table, RentalCustInsertAudit, that maintains/captures the records inserted 
-- on RentalCust table. The audit table also capture the date the insertion took place
-- Note : Use FOR/AFTER INSERT trigger as required.


-- EXERCISE - TRIGGER # 11  (AFTER INSERT TRIGGER, Application for Audit) (*)
-- Create Audit table, Medicine_Insert_Audit, that maintains/captures the new mId, BrandName, 
-- the person that made the entery, the date/time of data entery.
-- Use system function 'SYSTEM_USER' to get login detail of the user that perform data insertion


-- Now create a trigger that automagically inserts data into the MedicineInsertAudit table, 
-- whenever data inserted into Medicine table


-- Test how the trigger works by inserting one row data to Medicine table


-- EXERCISE - TRIGGER # 12 (AFTER DELETE TRIGGER, Application for Archive) (*)
-- Create and use archieve table, Disease_Delete_Archive, that archieves the disease information
-- deleted from Disease table. The same table must also capture the time and the person 
-- that does the delete.
-- NOTE : Use system function SYSTEM_USER to return the system user.      


-- EXERCISE - TRIGGER # 13  (*)
-- Create a trigger that displays the following kind of message when a record is deleted from HotelCust table.
-- Assume the record for 'Abebe' is deleted, the trigger should display
-- 			'A record for Abebe is deleted from HotelCust table'  



-- EXERCISE - TRIGGER # 14 (AFTER UPDATE TRIGGER, Application for audit) (*)
-- Create an After Update Trigger on Employee table that documents the old and new salary information of 
-- an Employee and the date salary update was changed. 
-- First create EmployeePromotionTracker (empId, promoDate, oldSalary, newSalary)



-- Now check the tigger by updating one employee salary
-- First check the data in both tables



-- EXERCISE - TRIGGER # 15  ( AFTER UPDATE )
-- Create the following audit table, RentalCust_Update_Audit, and code a trigger that 
-- can maintains/captures the updated record/s of RentalCust table.
 
-- Assume both the fist name and DoB changed during update, The 'Message' column should capture 
-- a customized statement as follows
-- 	  'First Name changed from 'Abebe' to 'Kebede', DoB changed from 'old DoB' to 'new DoB'

-- Similarly the 'Message' column should be able to capture all the changes that took place.



-- EXERCISE - TRIGGER # 16 (*)
-- Create Medicine_Audit table, with two columns having Integer with IDENDITY function and description - nvarchar(500) 
-- data types. The table must insert a description for the changes made on Medicine table during UPDATE




-- EXERCISE - TRIGGER # 18 (After Delete Trigger ) (*)
-- Create a trigger that archieve the list of Terminated/Deleted Employees.


-- Problem analysis :
-- The employee can be a Doctor, PharmacyPersonel or Just Employee. Since, Doctor and 
-- PharmacyPersonnel tables depend on the Employee table, we need to first redfine the foreign keys
-- to allow employee delete - with cascading effect. Then the next chalLENGTHge is, deleting a Doctor
-- also affecs the Diagnosis table, we should redefine the foreign key between Doctor and Diagnosis
-- table to allow the delete - with SET NULL effect


-- Steps to follow,
-- Step (1): Drop the Foreign Key Constraints from the Doctor, PharmacyPersonel, Diagnosis, and MedicineDispense tables
--           and redefine FK constraints for all child tables
-- Step (2): Create the Employee_Terminated_Archive table
-- Step (3): Create the trigger that inserts the deleted employee data into Employee_Terminated_Archive



-- Step (1): Drop the Foreign Key Constraints from the Doctor, PharmacyPersonel, Diagnosis, and MedicineDispense tables
--           and redefine FK constraints for all child tables


-- : Now redefine the Constraints


-- Step 2: Create the Employee_Terminated_Archive table


-- Step3: Create the trigger that inserts the deleted employee data into Employee_Terminated_Archive table 
-- by checking the role of the employee


-- Now test the trigger at work  by deleting an Employee - employee data will be archived, but 
-- the employee role wont be set as expected



-- EXERCISE - TRIGGER # 19 (*)
-- Modify the above trigger and archieve table to include the role of the employee if he/she is Doctor 
-- or PharmacyPersonel, and the date the employee was terminated.



-- Step3: Create the trigger that inserts the deleted employee data into Employee_Terminated_Archive table by checking the role of the employee



-- Now test the trigger at work  by deleting an Employee - employee data will be archived, but 
-- the employee role wont be set as expected


-- EXAMPLE - TRIGGER (Instead of Delete Trigger )
-- The above requirement can better be fulfilled within INSTEAD OF DELETE trigger as follows:
-- DROP TRIGGER trg_Instead_Of_Delete_Employee_Termination 


-- Now test deleting an employee that is a 1) Doctor 2) PharmacyPersonel and 3)any other employee



-- EXERCISE - TRIGGER # 20 ( Instead of Delete Trigger ) (*)
-- Create an Instead of delete trigger on Diagnosis table, that simply prints a warning 'You can't delete Diagnosis data!'




-- EXERCISE - TRIGGER # 19 - TRIGGER # 06  ( AFTER UPDATE )
-- Create the following audit table, RentalCust_Update_Audit, and code a trigger that 
-- can maintains/captures the updated record/s of RentalCust table. 



-- EXERCISE - TRIGGER # 21 ( Using triggers to insert data into multiple tables )
-- Inserting data into a view that is created from multiple base tables
-- First create the view - e.g. a view on Doctor and Employee tables ( vw_DoctorEmployee )



--  There are times where we want to insert data into tables through views,
--  Assume that we hired a doctor (an employee) having all the employee and doctor information; 
--  for this we want to insert data into both tables through the view vw_DoctorEmployee
--  But this will not  as intended, because of multiple base tables.... see below



-- Above insert statement will error out as follows
-- Error: 
-- Msg 4405, Level 16, State 1, Line 1763
-- View or function 'vw_DoctorEmployee' is not updatable because the modification affects multiple base tables.

-- Now create an instead of insert trigger on the view vw_DoctorEmployee -> that takes the data and inserts into 
-- the tables individually



--  Now retry the above insert statement
